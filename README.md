# Java-Project
In this project we have created a visual simulator of graph.
Here you have to enter the name and positions of the vertices and edges.
The program simulates the shortest output between any two vertices using Dijkstra algorithm and highlights the path using javaFX.
Use The MuditFinal folder for the code.
